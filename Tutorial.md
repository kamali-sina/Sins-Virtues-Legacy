## **Welcome to Sins & Virtues Toturial**

This game is completely text based. There are **no** full maps, **no** hints, **no** eagle vision, **no** nothing.
But that does not mean that you are completely blind! The protagonist constantly talks about his surroundings, everything he says is there for a reason, so don't skip all the dialogs!

## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

Everytime you see a little **>** on the screen it's your turn to play the game. You have a handful of commands that you can use in every situation that you can review by typing *commands*.

Each of the commands that you can use do use some time, this becomes important specially in the fights where losing time could mean death.

We suggest testing and exploring the commnads by yourself, but if you want more info on some commands you can view the Commands.md file.

## Player Dialogs

Your character will talk about his surrounding and everything he sees. The range of his vision is always a 1 block radius. This means that when your character says he sees "*A chest nearby*", it means that a block containing a chest is available in one of the 8 blocks around you. 

## Saving

The game is saved automatically whenever the prompt *Game Saved!* showes up on the screen. If you die you can reload from your last save and try another path!

## Day-Night Cycle

The game has an intergrated day-night cycle system. At day everything is normal, shops are open and people are friendly. But at nights everything is different. Enemies spawn everywhere, shops are closed and npcs will usually not speak with you. The rewards might be better, nevertheless we do not recommend exploring at nights.

**Note: The game times are calculated based on your commands and not by real time.**

## Game progression

As the days pass, the game gets harder and harder. So we recommend using the day-time to the fullest!

## Items

There are a lot of items in this game! Some of them are for fighting, some are for eating and some just help you progress. You can find out more about your items by using the ***inventory*** command. You can also use an item by using "***use*** <itemname>" command.

## The equip load system!

The more items you carry, the heavier you are. The game doesn't limit you on how much you can carry, but the more you carry, the slower you are which means travel times would be much more than normal and time will pass faster!

## Shops

There are some shops located in the game that you can use to sell your unwanted items and buy the things you want. The currencies in this game are **coins**.

Not all shopkeepers are the same, some have higher prices, some buy your items at a higher price. explore and find the shopkeeper that suits you the best.

## Blacksmiths

There are blacksmiths in the game that can help you upgrade your weapons. The currency for upgrading your weapons is called *Scarp* wich can be obtained by either scarpping an unwanted weapon or finding some in the world.

Each weapon has it's own upgrade path based on it's type. So we recommend upgrading every type of weapon and seeing the results by yourself.

## Homes

Homes are the safe heavens of this game. your progress gets saved here, your hp restores and the time skips to 5:00A.M of the next day. They also usually contain an item inside.

Not all homes are empty. Enter with **caution**. That small wolf might be the differance between life and death when you are wounded!

## Teleporters

No one knows how these teleporters work, but the legends say that they can move you to wherever you want in the world!

## Fights

Fights in this game are text based also. The only command for attacking that you have is "attack" that uses the equipped item to attack the enemy.

Each move you or your enemy make in a fight uses some time, the turns in the fights are calculated by using that time.

**Always** make sure to have equipped your best weapon before exploring into the unknown. You never know when yu are going to fight the next enemy and that extra *equip* might be what saves or kills you in the end.

## Status Effects

These are effects that can be applied to your character. They vary in the range of killing you to giving you a huge edge in battles. explore and find what you can do with these.

## **Castle**
To finish the game, you need to find the castle and explore it completely to the end. You have 2 options to find the castle:
*    explore blindly untill you come across the castle block
*    find a compass. by using a compass the compass directs you to the castle location.

**Always go into the castle prepared. The enemies in there will kill you easily if you are not well prepared.**



Happy Exploring, goodnight!
